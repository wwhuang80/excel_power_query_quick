# Various tricks
## Fill Up or Down
* In situations where a multi-level index is outputted to a format that doesn't support multi-level index, you may see data as shown below:

| Group | Category | Value |
|-------|----------|-------|
| A     | a        | 1     |
| null  | b        | 2     |
| B     | a        | 3     |
| null  | null     | 4     |

To fill the empty null values with the last non-null value in the rows above, select the column and click on **Fill Down**. Choose **Fill Up** if you want to fill the null values based on the next non-null value in the rows below. This option is in the *Transform* panel in Power Query.
